A really small static web server for Docker



### The goal
My goal is to create to smallest docker container for my web static files. The advantage of Go is that you can generate a fully static binary, so that you don't need anything else.

### Wait, I've been using old versions of GoStatic and things have changed!

Yeah, decided to drop support of unsecured HTTPS. Two-years ago, when I started GoStatic, there was no automatic HTTPS available. Nowadays, thanks to Let's Encrypt, it's really easy to do so. If you need HTTPS, I recommend [caddy](https://caddyserver.com).

### Features
 * A fully static web server in 6MB
 * No frameworkw
 * Web server build for Docker
 * Can generate certificate on his own
 * Light container
 * More security than official images (see below)
 * Log enabled

### Why?
Because the official Golang image is wayyyy to big (around 1/2Gb as you can see below) and could be unsecure.

For me, the whole point of containers is to have a light container...

### How to use
```
docker run -d -p 80:8043 -v path/to/website:/srv/http --name httpitzi pierrezemb/httpitzi
```

### Usage

```
./httpitzi --help
Usage of ./httpitzi:
  -append-header HeaderName:Value
        HTTP response header, specified as HeaderName:Value that should be added to all responses.
  -default-user-basic-auth string
        Define the user (default "gopher")
  -enable-basic-auth
        Enable basic auth. By default, password are randomly generated. Use --set-basic-auth to set it.
  -password-length int
        Size of the randomized password (default 16)
  -path string
        The path for the static files (default "/srv/http")
  -port int
        The listening port (default 8043)
  -set-basic-auth string
        Define the basic auth. Form must be user:password
```

### Wow, such container! What are you using?

I'm using the centurylink/ca-certs image instead of the scratch image to avoid this error:

```
x509: failed to load system roots and no roots provided
```

The centurylink/ca-certs image is simply the scratch image with the most common root CA certificates pre-installed. The resulting image is only 258 kB which is still a good starting point for creating your own minimal images.
